## Java projects for studies based on Clinet-Server architecture

Clientâ€“server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

### 1. Threads
Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.

### 2. Synchronized 
The Java programming language provides two basic synchronization idioms: synchronized methods and synchronized statements. The more complex of the two, synchronized statements, are described in the next section.

### 3. Server socket
The server in the client/server pair serves up Knock Knock jokes. Knock Knock jokes are favored by children and are usually vehicles for bad puns. 

### 4. Server Stream - Data Flow
Reading from and Writing to a Socket

### 5,6,7. Client
Client is the main entry point to the fluent API used to build and execute client requests in order to consume responses returned.

### 8. Server multi-thread
A server having more than one thread is known as Multithreaded Server. When a client sends the request, a thread is generated through which a user can communicate with the server. We need to generate multiple threads to accept multiple requests from multiple clients at the same time.

### (9,10-none), 11. RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
Java RMI is a Java API that performs remote method invocation, the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC), with support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage-collection.

### 12. Datagram
Java DatagramSocket class represents a connection-less socket for sending and receiving datagram packets.
A datagram is basically an information but there is no guarantee of its content, arrival or arrival time.
